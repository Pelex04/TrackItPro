Overview
TrackItPro is a web-based application designed to help users build and maintain positive habits through a gamified experience. It allows users to create, manage, and track habits while earning points, badges, and streaks to boost motivation. The system features a responsive, mobile-first interface, secure authentication, and analytical insights into user progress. The target audience includes students, professionals, and fitness enthusiasts looking to improve their daily or weekly routines.

Set Up the Database:

Create a MySQL database (e.g., trackitpro).
Run the following SQL to create the required tables:CREATE DATABASE trackitpro;
USE trackitpro;

CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    preferences TEXT,
    reset_token VARCHAR(255),
    reset_expires DATETIME,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE habits (
    habit_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    frequency ENUM('daily', 'weekly') NOT NULL,
    goal INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (habit_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE progress (
    progress_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    habit_id INT,
    date_completed DATE NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (progress_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (habit_id) REFERENCES habits(habit_id)
);

CREATE TABLE rewards (
    reward_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT,
    badge_name VARCHAR(255),
    points INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (reward_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);


Update the database configuration in config/database.php with your credentials:<?php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'trackitpro');
define('DB_USER', 'your_username');
define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');
?>




Configure the Web Server:

Point your web server (e.g., Apache) to the projectâ€™s public/ directory.
Ensure .htaccess is enabled for URL rewriting.
Enable HTTPS for secure communication.


Run the Application:

Navigate to http://localhost/trackitpro in your browser.
Register a new account or log in to start tracking habits.
